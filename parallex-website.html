                What is a Brain Tumor?<br><br>
                A brain tumor refers to an abnormal mass or collection of cells growing uncontrollably in the brain.<br><br>
                A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or its surrounding tissues. Tumors can be non-cancerous or cancerous, and they disrupt normal brain function by pressing on or invading healthy tissue.
                Symptoms can include headaches, seizures, vision problems, and difficulty with coordination or speech, depending on the tumor's location. Brain tumors can develop from brain cells, the membranes covering the brain, or from cancer that has spread from other parts of the body. Early detection through MRI or CT scans is crucial for treatment.

                A healthy brain is one that functions optimally, supporting cognitive processes such as thinking, memory, learning, and emotional regulation. It is characterized by clear thinking, good concentration, and emotional stability. Maintaining brain health involves a balanced diet, regular physical exercise, mental stimulation, adequate sleep, and managing stress.
                <br><br>
                To maintain a healthy brain, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, get adequate sleep, stay mentally active, manage stress, socialize, stay hydrated, avoid harmful substances, and have regular health check-ups.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                MRI scans of a healthy brain provide detailed, high-resolution images that reveal the brainâ€™s normal structure and function. In these scans, the brain appears as a well-defined organ with distinct areas such as the cortex, white matter, and ventricles clearly visible. The gray matter, responsible for processing information, and the white matter, which facilitates communication between different brain regions, are both easily distinguishable.
                <br><br>
                A healthy MRI scan shows no unusual masses, lesions, or abnormalities in size or shape. The ventricles, which are fluid-filled cavities in the brain, are of normal size and shape. Overall, these scans serve as a baseline to compare with any potential abnormalities that may arise in future diagnostic evaluations.

                <h2 class="desc">Diagnosis</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                A brain tumor is diagnosed through a combination of imaging tests and medical evaluations. Typically, MRI or CT scans are used to identify the presence, size, and location of the tumor. Additional tests, such as a biopsy or lumbar puncture, may be performed to determine the tumor's type and grade. Neurological exams and patient history also help in forming a comprehensive diagnosis.
                <br><br>
                To diagnose a brain tumor, doctors generally start with imaging techniques like MRI or CT scans to locate and assess the tumor. A biopsy may be done to analyze the tumor cells and confirm the type and grade. Neurological tests and a review of symptoms and medical history are also used to support the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment.
